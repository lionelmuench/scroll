# Scroll Word Puzzle

This project contains a small word puzzle game implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Open `index.html` for the main landing page, and use `challenge.html` or `zen.html` for the different game modes.

The original `script.js` file used in early prototypes is no longer part of the application. It has been archived in the `archive/` folder for reference and is not loaded by any of the pages.
